How our business operates:
> [GitHub](https://www.idealistic.ai/github) is where you are currently and is used to notify you of our operations but also showcase a selected part of our work.

> [Discord](https://www.idealistic.ai/discord/exclusive) is used for communication where we also host our application so you can manage your Idealistic AI account.

> [Patreon](https://www.idealistic.ai/patreon) is used for subscription purchases where a customer pays to become a member of a tier for a while and receives benefits in exchange.

> [BuiltByBit](https://builtbybit.com/creators/63108/) is used for one-time purchases where a customer pays for certain goods and receives them upon completion.

```In simple terms, you can find our work on GitHub, purchase through Patreon and BuiltByBit, and eventually use Discord to stay in touch with us. Depending on your needs, you may need to create one or multiple accounts on these platforms.```
